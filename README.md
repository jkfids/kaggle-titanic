The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 is a culturally significant tragedy that resulted in the deaths of 1502 out of 2224 passengers. Today, it serves as an interesting case study for machine learning and data analysis as survival rates of passengers seem to correlate with certain passenger features.

This is a repository of solutions for Kaggle's Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition, where participants build ML models to predict the survival outcome of passengers. It serves as my introduction to Kaggle, machine learning, and data science.
